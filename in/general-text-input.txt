A strongly-typed programming 	language is one in      which each type of data (such as integer, character,   	 hexadecimal, 	packed decimal, and so	 forth) is predefined as part 	of the programming language and all constants or variables defined for a given program must be described with one of the 	data types. 

Certain operations may be 	allowable only with 	certain data types.
